## Future Features
Given the project utilizes JavaScript, some relevant features could include:
* **Asynchronous operations:** Leverage `async/await` or Promises for improved performance and responsiveness.
* **Dynamic content updates:** Implement features that fetch and display data dynamically using JavaScript's capabilities (e.g., fetching data via API calls).
* **Interactive elements:** Incorporate elements like animations, transitions, and interactive forms to enhance user engagement.
* **Modern JavaScript frameworks:** Consider using a framework like React, Vue, or Angular to structure the application and improve development efficiency (if scalability becomes a consideration).
This README will be updated as the project evolves and more features are implemented.
